● Based on my research of the documentation, here's the answer to your questions:

  Phase 6B and 6C Content

  Phase 6B (Video Generation):
  - Runway Gen-3 Alpha integration for cinematic cutscenes
  - Video generation UI in Campaign Studio
  - Campaign intro/outro videos
  - NOT AI map generation or TTS for gameplay

  Phase 6C (Content Editors):
  - Visual map editor with PixiJS
  - NPC editor with dialogue trees
  - Quest editor with objectives
  - Encounter designer
  - NOT AI map generation or TTS for gameplay

  Where AI Map Generation & Gameplay TTS Are

  According to docs/51_Gameplay_Implementation_Plan.md, these are in later phases:

  | Feature               | Phase                    | Document Reference                                  |
  |-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
  | AI Map Generation     | Phase 2 of Gameplay Plan | Claude generates map JSON, NanoBanana renders tiles |
  | Voice Narration (TTS) | Phase 4 of Gameplay Plan | ElevenLabs for DM narration, NPC dialogue           |
  | Combat System         | Phase 5 of Gameplay Plan | Attack rolls, spell casting, VFX                    |

  Can Gameplay Start After All Phases?

  Yes. After completing all 8 phases, you'll have:

  1. Full D&D 5e Combat - Initiative, attacks, spells, saving throws, death saves
  2. Real-time Multiplayer - WebSocket sync for all players
  3. AI-Generated Content - Maps, NPCs, encounters, quests via Claude
  4. Cinematic Experience - Runway video cutscenes, ElevenLabs voice narration
  5. Visual Effects - Spell animations, damage numbers, particle effects
  6. Complete Character System - RAW 5e character creation with AI portraits
